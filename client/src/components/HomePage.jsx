    <h2>What's the problem with grocery lists?</h2>
    <p>I don't know about you, but I'm always making a new one, over and over, struggling to remember what it is that I usually buy at Whole Foods -- oh and what is it we always forget when we're at Costco?</p>
    <h2>We've made it easy for you.</h2>
    <p>Your Last Grocery List makes suggestions based on your old grocery lists. No more wracking your brain. Quickly add the items you need and get shopping!</p>
